\begin{dndclass}{The Old Ones}{
Unwilling warrior or bloodthirsty vanguard, the Eldritch Warlock has contracted with those most powerful and terrible of creatures -- the Old Gods, harbingers of great doom and leaders of the Eldritch Invasion. Whether through unworldly guile or hapless foolishness, these warlocks exchange something of mortal value to gain favor with an Old God. They make fearsome allies and formidable foes, although their allegiance may be somewhat suspect - as no one, least of all the warlock, knows when their terrible master may call upon them for some unspeakable act.}
