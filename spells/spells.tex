	{Instantaneous}
	That which is done can be undone -- at least, where the flesh is concerned. You lash out at an enemy of your choice, the shadows bending to your will. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. The target takes 6d8 necrotic damage on a failed throw or half as much on a successful one.
	\paragraph{At Higher Levels} When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each spell slot above 3rd.
