\begin{dndcharacter}[test]{Soren}{Human Beastmaster}
\characterinfo{Rangers Hunt Alone}{Soren lived much of his life in the Human settlement of Mai'Tech with his mother. When his mother died, he couldn't stay there anymore, and left in search of his errant father --- and an explanation for his mother's last words to him. He found his way to Ha'ard to take shelter for the night, and joined up with the group there.}

\begin{dndcharacter}[she big]{Beth}{Half-Orc Shadow Tinkerer}
\characterinfo{The Deep}
{Beth has a lot of two things: family members and secrets. Half-orc and half\dots{}something, she hides her scales beneath layers of colorful scarves. She was working at Ha'ard as a clothier when Benoweth and Soren rolled into town; the rest is history.}

\begin{dndcharacter}[Hulking Albino]{Krack}{Half-Orc Order of the Abomination}
\characterinfo{Thankless Work}
{Krack has stared into the abyss for so long that the abyss has started to stare back. An Abomination, Krack consumed the Eldritch sanguine essence of a cave beast and underwent a painful transformation which gave him powerful new abilities --- as well as a sense of foreboding that never seems to go away.\newline Those who aren't intimidated by his hulking form tend to focus instead on his eyes, which are slitted like the monster whose essence he consumed. Krack, and the other Blood Hunters, work for the good of all, despite the general fear and distrust that accompanies them through every tavern they might rest at.\newline Krack was working as a guard for Ha'ard when the attack occurred.}
