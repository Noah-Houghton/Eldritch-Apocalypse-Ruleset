\section{Elixirs}
Elixirs are not your everyday potions; made particularly potent by Eldritch infusion, Elixirs are more powerful and, often, more dangerous than their standard counterparts. This power comes with some drawbacks, as the Eldritch essence makes certain aspects of the potion\dots{}unstable.

Because of this relationship to the unnatural, drinking an Elixir will raise a character's Monstrosity rating.
