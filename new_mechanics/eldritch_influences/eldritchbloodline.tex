\section{Eldritch Bloodlines}
Though not all people were affected by the Eldritch Awakening enough to transform into a magical race, the Eldritch heritage of every being was reawakened. When creating a character using this ruleset, players also choose an Eldritch Bloodline. This influences cosmetic aspects of the character, small stat changes, and a character's Eldritch Manifestation. The Bloodlines presented below are not meant as an exhaustive list, but rather a set of examples for the Dungeon Master to use as guidance in populating their own setting.

\begin{dndbloodline}[DEX +1, WIS -1]{Soggoth}{Descendants of the Deep God often have eyes with larger pupils, scales on their body, or small gill-like lines on their necks.}{Fishman}
\bloodlineinfo{Deep God}{Soggoth is a god of the deep yo}

\end{dndbloodline}
